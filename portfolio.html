				<p>The main purpose of this app was to allow users to post and search for books that can either be bought, sold, or traded. I implemented the user login and persitent login. As well as working with my teamates to allow users to post, and expand detail when post is selected. We plan to improve our app by allowing users to post images of their books, and allow for user interactions such as follow, like, add to wishlist.

				<h5>September 2020 - Present</h5>
				<p>I have been interested in animation. Specifically with how code can create such objects. In hopes to expand my knowledge and learn how to get into this field, I was introduced to this open source project by a professor. To contribute to the open source I created a pull request to better the documentation for those who are building on MacOS. My goal for this personal project is to go through the tutorials and build a USD plugin.</p>

				<h5>June 2020</h5>
				<p>In the beginning of the pandemic one of my teams main concern was fitness. We found that as students staying motivated during this time was difficult. We created a web application with the intentions of motivationg people by making it easy to access basic at home exercise and nutrition facts. My team and I implemented a BMI API, a nutrition API, and multiple html pages.</p>

				<h5>July 2019 - Present</h5>
				<p>CSin3 is rigorous program that provides a pathway for students to get their Bachelor's degree in three years. In addition to students attending school year round they must also attend madatory workshops to improve their CS skillset. Workshops such as IPS and ABC's have helped me improve my problem solving skills, build my resume, and overall helped navigate my intrests in the CS field.</p>

				<h5>August 2020 - Present</h5>
				<p>CodePath offers supplemental courses to computer science students. During the first half of the course, we build our skills through labs/projects using the API's of popular apps like Flix, Twitter, and Instagram. Then we apply what weâ€™ve learned in the second half of the course, working together in small teams to build a completely original app from the ground up. Hence Book Exchange!</p>

				<h5>August 2020 - Present</h5>
				<p>Pixar in a Box is course offered by Khan Academy and Pixar. This course has introduced me to elements such as story telling, simulations, rigging, and more that go into making an animated movie. I have been interested in animation and Pixar in a Box showed me that I can use my CS degree and be a part of the story!
